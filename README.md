# Resources for Plum Wine Appliance Owners
While the original Plum wine appliance is no longer in production (its name and patented technology have been acquired by C+A Global), many owners of this at-home wine-by-the-glass device are still interested in community support. This repo serves as a collection of resources, guides, and code meant to keep our appliances running without any official support.
